    "My process for this project was actually very well plotted thanks to the course and how it was paced. I think that if I had started from scratch and been told to look up fast modular exponentiation on my own I would have felt overwhelmed. However, going through step by step starting with how a modulo works, going over number theory and primes, and working all the way up to Bezout's Theorem and Modular inverses really helped me out a ton. It was a slow but incredibly valuable journey. I took my time and tried to implement spaced repetition with these methods because honestly it takes me a while to fully understand what's going on. This has disheartened me in the past but seeing these methods and theorems implmented in real time has really been such an incredible learning moment for me, and the fact that I feel I've been able to understand it has been a testament to this classes multi-modal learning methods: Watching the lectures, reading the book, doing the mastery workbooks, it's been so absolutley rigerous and phenomenal for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "I digress, so when starting this project I was on week 7, and I came in and wrote Fast Modular Exponentiation which was a challenge in itself but after just touching on this material for the class it felt very doable, it also helped me chunk this project because after writing just a single working function it made me feel very capable and as if at least a small piece of the project was completed and that I had already started. In my experience starting a big project is always the hardest part, going from thought to action is a big blocker, but with small steps it felt much more feasible.\n",

    "After starting the project on week 7 for Fast Modular Exponentiation, I started taking a look at the project just to get a feel for what was coming. It primed my brain for material to watch out for and how it would connect. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think the most challenging piece of this whole project was getting all the pieces to fit together nicely, and ensure that there were no hiccups and that each function was used in the proper context. It was great to have FME and EEA, but if I used them in the improper context it could be a situation much like in cooking where I started to add add salt to just a plain pan, if there's no meat or vegtables or tofu to season why am I adding salt to an empty pan? The order mattered a lot is what I learned through the videos and textbook. Another way this was like cooking for me was honestly in that I had to look at the recipe a few times to make sure that I didn't miss any ingredients that might make it taste weird! Even reading the recipe once for me sometimes isn't enough and I need to go back and double check. \n",
